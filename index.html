                 How to Pick Coconuts to Get Coconut Water 
                 <ol>
                    <li>Gently tip the back of the machete or rowboat oar against the top of the coconut to 
                        remove the cap where the stem was attached.</li>
                    <li>Tap the back of the machete or oar against the husk to create a narrow grove.</li>
                    <li>Hold the coconut vertically with the chopped of cap facing up and use the hook of
                        the machete or oar to stab into the husk near the top, about an inch from the 
                        groove you've created.</li>
                    <li>Twist the machete or oar away from the groove to split off the coconut husk.</li>
                    <li>Lightly tap the centerline of the coconut with the back of the machete or oar
                        to crack open the coconut and get the water inside of it.</li>

                 How to Pick the Other Fruits Off of the Palm Trees
                 <ul>
                    <li>For papayas and mangoes, use the same technique you use to chop off coconuts.</li>
                    <li>For bananas, make diagonal cuts around the branch holding them up. </li>
                    <li>For pineapples, carefully cut them, leaving 2-3 inches of the stem that 
                        held them up.</li>
